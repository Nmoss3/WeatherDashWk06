# WeatherDashWk06

## Description
I was expected to recreate a Weather Dashboard using https://openweathermap.org/api.
The application allows users to search for cities and see the current temperature, UVindex, wind speeds and humidity for the current day along with providing a 5 day future forecast for that city.

Dont worry, the application will save this data for you in localStorage so if you ever want to go back to view it you can.

The application allows users to visualize the weather by providing icons.

If the user wants to go back to a city that they previously searched, they can do so by clicking on the city in the search history section of the application. As a user you can also delete the search history so no one will know you expected different weather to be happening in Arizona other than HOT ALL THE TIME.

## Deployment
This application was deployed through github pages.
